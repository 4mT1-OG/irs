# The Ingenious Redistribution System (IRS)

_**Downloads or streams media from the name of the song / album / movie / tv-show.**_

Currently the system can stream or download the following:
 - Specific songs.
 - Complete albums.
 - Movies.
 - TV shows.

When downloading music, the system will fill out the specific meta-data so that it will appear organized in your player of choice. It parses the following pieces of meta-data:
 - Title.
 - Artist.
 - Album.
 - Album cover/art.*
 - Year released.
 - Tracknumber.*

<sup>\* Album art is slightly buggy, and tracknumber only works when downloading complete album.<sup>

### NOTE THAT THE README IS CURRENTLY BEING WORKED ON.
