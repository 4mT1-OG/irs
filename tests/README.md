# Travis CI tests are wierd
Tests with `ffmpeg` are wierd on Travis. It's a fact that I've had to deal with for 25 commits in total. So, the only songs I've found *so far* that work with ffmpeg are from the album `Da Frame 2R / Matador` by `Arctic Monkeys`. It's really lame, but don't mess around with them.
